          1. Difference between local storage and session storage?

          <p class="card-text">
            a. Local storage isn't session based, the data has to be deleted via
            javaScript or manually. Session storage is session based and works
            untill the window or tab is closed. If the window or tab is closed
            then the data inside session storage are lost.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            b. Size of Local storage is 10 mb and the size of Session storage is
            5 mb.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            c. Both of them doesn't send data to the server. There are few old
            browser that supports the local storage and session storage.

          2. Difference between global scope and block scope?
        </h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          Before there was only global scope and local scope. But after let and
          const now there are global scope, block scope and function scope. We
          will be talking only about global scope and block scope.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          If you declare a varibale Globally outside of function or { } curly
          braces then it's has global scope. The value of that varibale can be
          accessed from anywhere.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          If you declare any variable (other than var) inside { } curly braces
          than it is block scoped. The value can be accessed only inside the { }
          curly braces. The value can't be accessed outside of { } curly braces.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Now if you declare a varibale globally but didn't assign any value.
          Then you assigned that varibale value inside a fucntion. You can still
          use that variable value globally.
