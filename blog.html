          1. Difference between local storage and session storage?
        </h2>
        <div>
          <p class="card-text">
            a. Local storage isn't session based, the data has to be deleted via
            javaScript or manually. Session storage is session based and works
            untill the window or tab is closed. If the window or tab is closed
            then the data inside session storage are lost.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            b. Size of Local storage is 10 mb and the size of Session storage is
            5 mb.
          </p>
          <p class="card-text">
            c. Both of them doesn't send data to the server. There are few old
            browser that supports the local storage and session storage.

          2. Difference between global scope and block scope?
        </h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          Before there was only global scope and local scope. But after let and
          const now there are global scope, block scope and function scope. We
          will be talking only about global scope and block scope.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          If you declare a varibale Globally outside of function or { } curly
          braces then it's has global scope. The value of that varibale can be
          accessed from anywhere.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          If you declare any variable (other than var) inside { } curly braces
          than it is block scoped. The value can be accessed only inside the { }
          curly braces. The value can't be accessed outside of { } curly braces.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          Now if you declare a varibale globally but didn't assign any value.
          Then you assigned that varibale value inside a fucntion. You can still
          use that variable value globally.

        <h2 class="card-heading">3. How JavaScript Event loop works?</h2>
        <p class="card-text">
          JavaScript is a single threaded language. But when JavaScript runs in
          the browser it can do many things at once. Now when the code is run,
          it keeps all the fucntion calls inside of a call stack. Whichever code
          is at the top of the call stack it runs that code at first then runs
          all the other in order. If you have a asyncronus function it will run
          at the call stack first but then the broweser web api will send that
          asyncronus function in the call stack queue. Now the Event Loop pulls
          the code out of that queue and places it on top of the call stack and
          executes it. That way javaScript creates a illusion that it's running
          code at multiple thread and our websites runs more dynamically.

        <p class="card-text" git>There are 8 ways we can get undefined.</p>
        <p class="card-text">
          a. By declaring a variable and not initializing any value to it, will
          give you undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          b. If you declare a function and don't return anything. it will give
          you undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          c. If you don't pass any parameter inside a function it will give
          undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          d. If return doesn't have anything on the right side you will get
          undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          e. If an property doesn't exist in a object you will get undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          f. If you access array elements outside of index range it wiil give
          undefined.
        </p>
        <p class="card-text">
          g. If you delete an element inside an array and try to access it, It
          will give undefined.
        </p>
